# berryboot integration scripts
Repo for (hopefully) usefull berryboot integration scripts for various popular distributions

For each supported Distibution, a 1-line shell command is given to run an installer which downloads a genuine image, patches-it, and installs it for use inside berryboot.

Such patched image is then capable of supporting all Distribution features by itself, including auto-updates, resets, etc...

Therefore, the 1-line install command is only needed (once) for initial image creation: such installed image is then totally "autonomous", as would be a regular native Distribution install.
